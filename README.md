# Industry Insights

A collection of code samples from the "happtiq Industry Insights" series, showcasing Google Cloud patterns across real-world scenarios. Each subfolder pairs with a blog post that explains the story, architecture, and key design decisions.

## What’s Inside
- **Project directories**: One folder per story/example; see each `README.md` for setup and context.
- **Data and assets**: Supporting datasets or config files live alongside the relevant project.
- **Scripts**: Utility scripts (e.g., indexing, ingestion, or demo automation) stay within their project folders.

## Getting Started
1) Clone the repo: `git clone https://github.com/your-org/industry-insights.git`
2) Pick a project folder and read its `README.md` for prerequisites, setup, and run steps.
3) Optional: create and activate a Python or Node virtual environment as required by the project.

## Common Requirements
- A Google Cloud project with sufficient permissions for the services used in each sample.
- Local tooling as noted in each project.
